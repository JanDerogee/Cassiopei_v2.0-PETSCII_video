# Cassiopei_v2.0-PETSCII_video
A PETSCII_video_player for the Casiopei v2.0

Using a PC tool, videos (no sound) can be converted into a set of images consistingof PETSCII characters.
This can be compressed or uncompressed. It allows for playback of simple (cartoon-like or linebased) videos. Anything that has a highcontrast is useable, don't expect your favority episode of Star Trek to be converted and viewable, resolution is simply too low for that. But a la-linea cartoon works quite well.
